# SushiSwap V3 Liquidity Management Challenge Solution

This project implements a gas-efficient Liquidity Manager for SushiSwap V3 pools, focusing on the WETH/USDC pair. The system consists of a Solidity smart contract for managing liquidity positions and collecting fees.

## System Architecture

The Liquidity Manager operates through:
- Smart Contract: Handles position creation, monitoring, and fee collection
- SushiSwap V3 Core: Interacts with the underlying pool contracts
- Off-chain Monitoring: Can be implemented to track position performance

### Workflow

1. User approves tokens to the Liquidity Manager contract
2. User creates a new liquidity position with desired parameters
3. Position is monitored for accumulated fees and price changes
4. User can collect accumulated fees at any time
5. Position can be closed or adjusted as needed

## Smart Contract

The LiquidityManager contract is deployed and verified on Sepolia testnet:
- Address: `0xd8604D72626FB914dA8c3A5AcF3D877a611A3EEd`
- Network: Sepolia (Chain ID: 11155111)
- [View on Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xd8604D72626FB914dA8c3A5AcF3D877a611A3EEd)

### Key Features

- Create concentrated liquidity positions
- Monitor position status and accumulated fees
- Collect trading fees in both WETH and USDC
- Gas-optimized operations
- Support for custom fee tiers and tick ranges

## Development

### Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd liquidity-manager
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   forge install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables by copying the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   forge test
   ```

### Usage Examples

#### Create Position

```solidity
INonfungiblePositionManager.MintParams memory params = INonfungiblePositionManager.MintParams({
    token0: WETH_ADDRESS,
    token1: USDC_ADDRESS,
    fee: 3000,
    tickLower: -60,
    tickUpper: 60,
    amount0Desired: 0.1 ether,
    amount1Desired: 100e6,
    amount0Min: 0,
    amount1Min: 0,
    recipient: msg.sender,
    deadline: block.timestamp + 1 days
});
(uint256 tokenId, uint128 liquidity, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = 
    manager.createPosition(params);
```

#### Collect Fees

```solidity
(uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = manager.collectFees(tokenId);
```

#### Monitor Position

```solidity
(
    uint128 liquidity,
    uint256 feeGrowthInside0LastX128,
    uint256 feeGrowthInside1LastX128,
    uint128 tokensOwed0,
    uint128 tokensOwed1
) = manager.getPosition(tokenId);
```

### Running Tests

The project includes comprehensive smart contract tests using Foundry:

```bash
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run with gas reporting
forge test --gas-report
```

This structure represents a complete Foundry project for the SushiSwap V3 Liquidity Manager. Key components are organized as follows:
- Smart Contract: Located in `src/LiquidityManager.sol`
- Interfaces: Stored in `src/interfaces/`
- Tests: Comprehensive test suite in `test/LiquidityManager.t.sol`
- Deployment Script: Found in `script/Deploy.s.sol`
- Configuration: Environment variables and Foundry settings

## Security Considerations

- Proper input validation for all function parameters
- Use of OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 for token transfers
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern followed
- Position ownership verification before operations
- Slippage protection in position creation

## Quality Assurance

- Clean, well-documented code
- Gas-optimized implementation
- Adherence to Solidity best practices
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Integration tests with forked mainnet
